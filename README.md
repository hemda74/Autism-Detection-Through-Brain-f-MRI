# Machine learning approaches to the classification problem for autism spectrum disorder
We'll be using the "Autistic Spectrum Disorder Screening Data for Adult And Toddels" public dataset from the UCI repository. The datset was donated by Prof. Fadi Thabtah, after being published in the article "Autism Spectrum Disorder Screening: Machine Learning Adaptation and DSM-5 Fulfillment". You can find the article by Fadi Thabtah online. The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the 'age_desc' feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries. Very few published articles are available online as the dataset has not been out for long and as a result refernce to a benchmark model is very rare.

Abstract: Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment condition associated with significant healthcare costs, and early diagnosis can significantly reduce these. Unfortunately, waiting times for an ASD diagnosis are lengthy and procedures are not cost effective. The economic impact of autism and the increase in the number of ASD cases across the world reveals an urgent need for the development of easily implemented and effective screening methods. Therefore, a time-efficient and accessible ASD screening is imminent to help health professionals and inform individuals whether they should pursue formal clinical diagnosis.

The rapid growth in the number of ASD cases worldwide necessitates datasets related to behaviour traits. However, such datasets are rare making it difficult to perform thorough analyses to improve the efficiency, sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of the ASD screening process. Presently, very limited autism datasets associated with clinical or screening are available and most of them are genetic in nature. Hence, we propose a new dataset related to autism screening of adults that contained 20 features to be utilised for further analysis especially in determining influential autistic traits and improving the classification of ASD cases. In this dataset, we record ten behavioural features (AQ-10-Adult) plus ten individuals characteristics that have proved to be effective in detecting the ASD cases from controls in behaviour science.

Road Map:
### Step 0: Import Datasets.

### Step 1: Clean Datasets (The data needs to be cleaned; many rows contain missing data, and there may be erroneous data identifiable as outliers).

### Step 2: A quick visualization with Seaborn.

### Step 3: At First, We applied several Supervised Machine Learning (SML) techniques on the data for classification purpose.

### Step 4: Next, We experimented with different topologies, optimizers, and hyperparameters for different models.

### Step 5: Model tuning.

### Step 6: Feature Selection.

### Step 7: Then We built a Multi-Layer Perceptron and train it to classify indivisual with ASD based on its features.

### Step 8: Conclusion.
